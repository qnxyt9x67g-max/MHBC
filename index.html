            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Maxwell Hill Baptist Church is a Bible based church located on the hill above Beckley West Virginia not directly affiliated with the Baptist denomination.</p>
            <p>The history of Maxwell Hill Baptist Church is rich in memories from its rural beginning until now. The story of the church is one of a people who loved the Lord and dedicated themselves to build a central place of worship as dictated by the needs of the community. The community has transformed from a small rural setting to a modern, well developed suburb of a small city. The history of the church reveals its adaptability to change and growth, as well as its resolve to remain steadfast in God’s principles. The message has always been the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <h3>1941</h3>
            <p>The idea for a church was born in 1941. God used the women of the community to become the founders of the church. Predicated by the need for a central place of worship and a desire to raise their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
            <h3>1942</h3>
            <p>The Maxwell Hill Baptist Church was officially organized on February 22, 1942, by a council representing the Raleigh Baptist Association. The association received the church into full fellowship later that year. Construction on a new church building began on July 25, 1942, as Dale Dixon plowed the first furrow with a horse owned by Herb Tolley. The building was not fully completed until December 1947, because the war created financial difficulties and many of the needed building supplies were not available. The basement was completed, though, and the first service was held on December 24, 1942.</p>
            <h3>1942 – 1964</h3>
            <p>The church had three different pastors in the first three years. Aden Brown was the first, followed by Harry L. Stevens, and then succeeded by Henry Smith in 1945. Henry Smith pastored until 1950. Landon Stanley pastored until 1964. During his pastorate, the church debt was retired. The 1960s brought rapid development to Maxwell Hill. In 1964, C.G. Walker replaced Landon Stanley as an interim pastor, agreeing to a one-year term.</p>
            <h3>1965 – 1991</h3>
            <p>In November of 1965, Clarence Griffith, Sr., a resident of Shady Spring, West Virginia, was selected to be the new full-time pastor. Plans were made in 1967 to construct a new building to facilitate growth. In March of 1977, the church voted to build a gymnasium, and construction was completed in July 1978. In the early part of 1991, Clarence Griffith asked the deacon board to begin the search for a new pastor as his health had deteriorated.</p>
            <h3>1991 – 1994</h3>
            <p>Pastor Ken began serving in June of 1991 and continues today as our Senior Pastor. Under Pastor Ken’s ministry, the church building was expanded by enlarging the sanctuary and adding several new classrooms in 1994.</p>
            <h3>1995</h3>
            <p>In 1995, the addition of another member of the pastoral staff was made when Bruce Dick came as the Youth Pastor. Bruce currently oversees the Youth Discipleship Ministry and serves as the coordinator for the Fellowship Center.</p>
            <h3>1998</h3>
            <p>In 1998, a vision and a purpose statement were established for our church. The purpose statement for the Maxwell Hill Baptist Church is as follows: Our purpose is to honor and glorify God by spreading the good news of Jesus Christ and by discipling those that God saves for the work of the ministry. The vision statement is what we desire to be a Church that is: Diligent in the Word, Delighted in Our Worship, and Determined in our Walk.</p>
            <p>MHBC has endeavored over the years to be true to the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is our resolve to remain faithful to this simple yet profound truth. We thank God for our existence.</p>
            <p>As the story of Maxwell Hill continues, we witness what Christ is doing in and through our church and we want to give all glory to God for what He has done and is doing.</p>

            <h2>What Kind of Church Are We</h2>
            <h3>OUR PURPOSE</h3>
            <p>In light of Matthew 28:18-19 the purpose of MHBC is to honor and glorify God by spreading the good news of Jesus Christ and discipling those that God saves for the work of the ministry.</p>
            <h3>OUR VISION</h3>
            <p>Just as families have various characteristics and traits that make them unique, so do churches. It is our desire to develop a character within our church that is honoring to our Lord and is conducive to healthy spiritual growth. We have developed a vision statement that we believe embodies the character of our church: To be diligent in The Word, delighted in our worship, and determined in our walk. It is in the spirit of this statement that we seek to minister to the Body of Christ.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Be Diligent In The Word –</strong> We are, without reservation, committed to the belief that the Bible is the Word of God. It is our conviction that diligence in The Word needs to be reflected, not only in the teaching and preaching ministry, but also in the everyday lives of our people. Diligence in the Word provides a knowledge of The Truth that produces freedom. This freedom provides a confidence that allows our church the flexibility to change the means of ministry in order to be culturally relevant and yet remain true to the message of the Bible. The principles of the Bible are timeless and are applicable to all people of all ages; therefore, it can, and must be presented in a manner that is relevant to the culture.</li>
                <li><strong>To Be Delighted In Our Worship –</strong> There are two aspects of this statement. First of all, we want our worship to be delight to our God, secondly, we want our worship to be a delightful experience for the worshippers. In order to accomplish this, we endeavor to create an atmosphere where the focus is upon the majesty and wonder of God and where believers would respond to Him fervently and with reverence. We want to encourage the people of our church not to limit their worship to the church services but to develop personal devotional lives that are a part of their everyday existence.</li>
                <li><strong>To Be Determined In Our Walk –</strong> We want the activities of our ministry to be deliberated and purposeful. We must constantly be evaluating our activities and programs to ensure they are effectively communicating the worthiness of our God and meeting the changing needs of people. We seek to enflame the hearts of God’s people with a passion for His will. We believe this is the highest motivation for a determined Christian walk. It is upon this basis that we seek the lost, both in our own neighborhood and through the support of missions and missionaries around the world. We also want to be determined in our care for one another. We are endeavoring to provide a small group ministry that will enable people to get to know one another on a level that will be conducive to the accomplishment of the one another commands of the New Testament.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="statement">
            <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
            <h3>The Godhead</h3>
            <p>We believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory. Having the same attributes and perfection, but each having His own distinct ministry in relation to His creation and people.</p>
            <h3>The Scriptures</h3>
            <p>We believe the Holy Scriptures, both the Old and New Testament, to be the verbally inspired Word of God, the final authority in all faith and life, inerrant in the original writings, infallible and God-breathed. We believe this divine inspiration extends to all parts of the writings – historical, poetical, doctrinal, and prophetic – as they appeared in the original manuscripts. We believe the Scriptures are for practical instruction in our day to day lives.</p>
            <h3>The Lord Jesus Christ</h3>
            <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man without ceasing to be God. Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary being perfect Deity and humanity, He came in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men.</p>
            <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through His death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and that by His literal physical resurrection made sure our justification, conquering death, Hell and the grave. We believe that His death is sufficient for the sins of the whole world; yet is effective only for those that believe.</p>
            <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, is now exalted at the right hand of God, whereas our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of representative, intercessor, and advocate, and that His imminent return will end the church age.</p>
            <h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
            <p>We believe the person of the Holy Spirit possess all the attributes of Deity. His ministry on earth is to convict men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement, and that He is the supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling, and sealing them unto the day of redemption.</p>
            <p>We believe the Holy Spirit is the Devine Teacher who guides all believers in truth and empowers them for fruitful service, and that is both a privilege and duty of all believers to be filled with (i.e. controlled by) the Spirit.</p>
            <p>We believe the Holy Spirit is one person of the triune Godhead and as such He is God. He is a person; He possesses the elements of personality, intellect, emotion and will.</p>
            <h3>Man</h3>
            <p>We believe that man was created by God in His own image, that he was created from the dust of the ground by a special supernatural act of God and not by any evolutionary process.</p>
            <p>We believe the Scriptural record of the fall of man; through Adam’s disobedience, sin and death were brought upon the whole human race; that through the fall the entire human race became alienated from God; and that man is totally depraved and, in and of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition.</p>
            <h3>Angels</h3>
            <p>We believe that angels do exist. We believe angels are created spiritual beings. They were created before the foundation of the world and in their original state were sinless. However, some followed Satan in his rebellion and thus are condemned in this ungodly state of being along with him.</p>
            <h3>Satan and Demons</h3>
            <p>Satan is a personal being, a fallen angel, and the author of sin; he was the influence in the fall of man; and he is the open and declared enemy of God and Christians. He will finally be bound and cast into the Lake of Fire to be tormented forever. The demons, which are the angels that followed Satan in his rebellion against God, will suffer the same judgement.</p>
            <h3>Salvation</h3>
            <p>We believe salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins.</p>
            <p>We believe all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s power through faith and are thus secure in Christ forever.</p>
            <p>We believe it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word, which clearly forbids the use of Christian liberties as an occasion to the flesh.</p>
            <p>We believe man is lost, he is totally depraved and separated from God. He is dead in his sins and trespasses and is without the desire or the ability to save himself. Therefore he is in need of a Savior.</p>
            <h3>The Last Days</h3>
            <p>Blessed Hope – According to the Word of God the next great event in the fulfillment of prophecy will be the coming of the Lord in the air to receive to Himself into heaven both His own who are alive and remain and also all who have fallen asleep in Jesus. This is the blessed hope (the rapture) set before us in Scripture, and for this we should be constantly looking. The rapture of the church will be pretribulational and premillennial. At the end of the seven year tribulation Christ will return to earth with the Saints and establish His Kingdom for a period of one thousand years.</p>
            <h3>The Church</h3>
            <p>The church which began at Pentecost (Acts 2), is the body and espoused bride of Christ and is a spiritual organism made up of all born again persons of this church age.</p>
            <p>The establishment and continuance of the local Church is clearly taught in the New Testament. Members of the universal Church should be organized in local churches. The local Church should be indigenous, self-supporting, self-governing and self propagating, each supreme in its own affairs, but cooperating in fellowship and work with those of like precious faith.</p>
            <p>The church is a living organism consisting of all individuals who have received Jesus Christ by faith, and such are born again, beginning at Pentecost and ceasing with the rapture.</p>

            <h2>C.A.R.E. Groups</h2>
            <p>C.A.R.E. Group Ministry is a time for the adults of the church to come together to share their lives while discussing truths communicated during the worship service. You are invited to join one of the groups that meet immediately following the morning service in our church facilities. The deacons and elders facilitate these groups and we encourage you to stay with the same group for an extended time so that the purpose of getting connected can be realized.</p>
            <h3>C</h3>
            <p>Community – … for we are members of one another. (Eph. 4:25)</p>
            <p>The concept of community is that of a group of people whose lives are connected. In the case of the church that which connects our lives is the common bond we share in Christ. The biblical word fellowship captures this idea and all the “One Another commands” insist that we facilitate genuine community. This is the objective that Care Groups seek to accomplish.</p>
            <h3>A</h3>
            <p>Accountability – … the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you (1 Cor. 12:21)</p>
            <p>The thought that a Christian can live independently of other Christians is totally foreign to the teaching of the Scriptures. Paul makes this abundantly clear in 1 Cor. 12 where he uses his favorite metaphor to describe the church, “The Body of Christ”. It is impossible for any member of our body to live apart from the rest of our members. Care Groups are designed to provide accountability for every member.</p>
            <h3>R</h3>
            <p>Reinforcement -… a threefold cord is not quickly broken (Eccl. 4:12)</p>
            <p>While each one possesses a certain amount of strength, none of us are sufficient within ourselves to live the Christian life. We need the strength of the Lord. Often the Lord supplies that strength through others. Trust is a key element when it comes to allowing others to minister to us in a time of weakness. Care Groups are intended to provide a format where trust can be built through time and close proximity.</p>
            <h3>E</h3>
            <p>Encouragement – But encourage one another day after day. (Heb. 3:13)</p>
            <p>Encouragement is such a needful part of the Christian’s life that God gifted certain members of His body with the ability to do just that, encourage others (Rom. 12:8). In a large group setting it can be difficult for the encourager and those that are in need of encouraging to find each other. Care Groups are intended to make it easier for us to encourage and to be encouraged by others.</p>

            <h2>Middle & High School Ministry (Teens Revolving Around Christ)</h2>
            <h3>WHY a teen group?</h3>
            <p>While not exclusively teens (since 6th graders are included), they come together because they have common age, interest, problems and issues of life. We see in 2 Timothy 2:22 that not only are they to “flee the wrong desires of youth”, but they are also to “pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”</p>
            <h3>WHY revolving?</h3>
            <p>It gives the sense of something being your primary focus. Since the teen years are filled with nonstop change and growth we want Christ to be the constant in their lives. He can be that primary focus. Matthew 22:36-37 says that the greatest focus we could have is loving God with all our heart, soul, and mind.</p>
            <h3>WHY around?</h3>
            <p>As followers of Christ, the center of our lives is to be Him not other aspects of life. In our teen years, it is so easy to get swept up by the latest greatest thing out. We want to have a focus that is centered on the purposes of Christ which we see in Matthew 28:19 as making disciples of Him.</p>
            <h3>WHY Christ?</h3>
            <p>He is the only one worthy. John 3:16 tells us that His love for us is so great that He gave His life for us. It is because of that love that we can be saved, by His grace through faith in Him, from a life and death in which we are eternally separated from Him.</p>
            <h3>What’s Our Purpose?</h3>
            <p>To glorify God by providing a ministry for & to MHBC teens through our Root to Fruit philosophy and our Grounding, Rooting, Growing, and Producing purpose. We want to provide a place where youth can come and feel accepted and welcomed and be helped in living out their relationship with Christ.</p>
            <h3>Who’s it for?</h3>
            <p>Youth from 6th – 12th grades are invited to join us. They are welcome to bring friends with them that are in the same age group.</p>
            <h3>When & Where we meet?</h3>
            <p>Sunday Morning – 10:45 – 11:30pm</p>

            <p>9-12th Grades – meet in room F102 in the basement of the Fellowship Center</p>

            <h2>Marriage</h2>
            <h3>Belief on Marriage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>We believe God sanctions marriage; and that it has only one meaning. Marriage joins one man and one woman in a single, exclusive union.</li>
                <li>We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to be expressed between a man and a woman and only within the context of marriage.</li>
                <li>We believe that human sexuality is sacred and that all forms of sexual immorality, such as adultery, fornication, homosexuality, bisexual conduct, bestiality, incest, pornography is offensive to God and is condemned in His Word.</li>
                <li>We believe that God offers redemption and restoration to all who confess and forsake their sin, seeking His mercy and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.</li>
