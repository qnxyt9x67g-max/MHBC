            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Maxwell Hill Baptist Church is a Bible based church located on the hill above Beckley West Virginia not directly affiliated with the Baptist denomination.</p>
            <p>The history of Maxwell Hill Baptist Church is rich in memories from its rural beginning until now. The story of the church is one of a people who loved the Lord and dedicated themselves to build a central place of worship as dictated by the needs of the community. The community has transformed from a small rural setting to a modern, well developed suburb of a small city. The history of the church reveals its adaptability to change and growth, as well as its resolve to remain steadfast in God’s principles. The message has always been the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <!-- ... rest of Our Story content as previously provided ... -->
            <p>As the story of Maxwell Hill continues, we witness what Christ is doing in and through our church and we want to give all glory to God for what He has done and is doing.</p>

            <h2>What Kind of Church Are We</h2>
            <h3>OUR PURPOSE</h3>
            <p>In light of Matthew 28:18-19 the purpose of MHBC is to honor and glorify God by spreading the good news of Jesus Christ and discipling those that God saves for the work of the ministry.</p>
            <h3>OUR VISION</h3>
            <p>Just as families have various characteristics and traits that make them unique, so do churches. It is our desire to develop a character within our church that is honoring to our Lord and is conducive to healthy spiritual growth. We have developed a vision statement that we believe embodies the character of our church: To be diligent in The Word, delighted in our worship, and determined in our walk. It is in the spirit of this statement that we seek to minister to the Body of Christ.</p>
